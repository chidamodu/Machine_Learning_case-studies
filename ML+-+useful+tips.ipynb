    "There is something called Recursive feature elimination to select the important features while building a ML model\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an external estimator that assigns weights to features (e.g., the coefficients of a linear model), recursive feature elimination (RFE) is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features. First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of features and the importance of each feature is obtained either through a coef_ attribute or through a feature_importances_ attribute. Then, the least important features are pruned from current set of features.That procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until the desired number of features to select is eventually reached.\n",

    "I use 10 fold cross validation in my test harnesses by default. All experiments (algorithm and dataset combinations) are repeated 10 times and the mean and standard deviation of the accuracy is collected and reported. I also use statistical significance tests to flush out meaningful results from noise. Box-plots are very useful for summarizing the distribution of accuracy results for each algorithm and dataset pair.\n",

    "I spot check algorithms, which means loading up a bunch of standard machine learning algorithms into my test harness and performing a formal experiment.
